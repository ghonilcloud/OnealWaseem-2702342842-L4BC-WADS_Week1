Web application development refers to the process of creating software applications that are designed to be accessed and used through web browsers. These applications run on web servers and are delivered to users online. Web applications can provide various functionalities and services, from simple web pages to complex, interactive platforms.

Key aspects of web application development include:

```
Client-Side Development: This involves creating the user interface (UI) components of the web application. Client-side development typically includes HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Server-Side Development: Server-side development focuses on building the back end of the web application. This includes designing and implementing the server logic, database management, user authentication, and business logic. Common programming languages for server-side development include Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Node.js.

Database Management: Web applications often require databases to store and manage data. Developers design and implement database schemas, create queries to retrieve and manipulate data, and ensure data integrity and security.

Frameworks and Libraries: Developers use frameworks and libraries to streamline the development process and ensure best practices. These tools provide pre-built components, structures, and patterns for routing, authentication, and data handling tasks.

Front-End and Back-End Communication: Communication between a web applicationâ€™s front-end and back-end components is essential. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable data exchange and interaction between the client and server.

Frontend Technologies

```
HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.
JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.
Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).

Frontend Frameworks/Libraries

```
React.js : A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
Angular : A full-fledged framework for building single-page applications (SPAs), with features like two-way data binding and dependency injection.
Vue.js : A progressive JavaScript framework that is flexible and can be used for building both simple and complex user interfaces.
